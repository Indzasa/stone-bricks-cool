# Stone Bricks Cool

This mod is an addition to Pyanadon's Hard Mode and utilizes the spoiling feature to make the experience harder and force you to create more complex builds.

Hot, warmer, and warm stone bricks cool down to their colder versions, eventually reaching regular stone bricks (the cooldown time can be changed in the settings). There is also an option where hot air requires the same amount of pressured air to be produced (without this option, recipes with hotter bricks produce more hot air than the compressed air they consume).
