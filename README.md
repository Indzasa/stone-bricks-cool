# Stone Bricks Cool

This mod is an addition to Pyanadon's Hard Mode and utilizes spoiling feature to make experience harder and force you to make more complex builds.

Hot, warmer and warm stone bricks cool down to their colder version, up to regular stone bricks (time can be changed in settings).
Also, there is an option: hot air takes same amount of pressured air to be made (without this option recipes with hotter bricks produce more hot air then they took compressed air in the first place).
